1) the explanation of how you calculate the confidence intervals


First I took 11 runs of 10000 values and obtained 11 means, 11 sample variences
using the two pass method, and then 11 sample variences using the single pass
method. then I took the mean and sample varience of the 11 means, the 11
single pass sample variences, and the 11 two pass variences. Finally after 
calculating those 6 values, I calculted 3 confidence Intervals using the mean's 
mean/varience, the single pass' mean/varience and the double pass' mean/varience

3) Explain how adding the constant C to every data item in steps 4â€“6 should affect
the sample variancen in theory. Describe what you observed in practice for the 
two formulas in Eq.(1) and Eq.(2).


In theory, having C be much larger shouldn't affect the results of the single
path method when compared to the double pass method. Both should result in generaly
the same value because that is what the equasions are ment to do. However, when
increasing the C in practice, as the number gets higher, the number squared
gets exponentialy higher, which causes rounding errors. Because the single pass
method compounds the mean while passing, these rounding errors also compounds
creating durastically wrong numbers
